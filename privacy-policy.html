<b>General</b>
Do Not Track
While QO-BOX  attempts to honor do not track (“DNT”) instructions we receive from a Visitor’s browser, we cannot guarantee that QO-BOX  will always respond to such signals, in part, because of the lack of common industry standard for DNT technology. We continue to monitor developments in DNT technology and stay apprised of DNT industry standards as they evolve.
